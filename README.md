# Assignment3
This repository includes 2 files besides the README.md file. 
The first file is the knitted rmarkdown of assignment 3, saved as .html. This includes only the output of all the statistical analyses and none of the r code. HTML was used because there were consistent errors when trying to knit as a pdf, even after downloading special packages. 
The second file is the original rmarkdown file, saved as a .rmd. This includes all of the code as well as comments and headers seen in the knitted file.
